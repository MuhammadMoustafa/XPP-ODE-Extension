## ðŸš€ How to Customize the Run Command

If youâ€™d like to change the default `xppaut` command to a custom command or specify the full path to the `xppaut` executable, follow these steps:

1. **Open VS Code Settings**  
   - You can access the settings by clicking on the gear icon in the lower-left corner of the VS Code window or by pressing `Ctrl + ,` (Cmd + , on macOS).

2. **Search for "XPP-ODE"**  
   - In the settings search bar, type "XPP-ODE" to locate the extension-specific settings.

3. **Modify the "Run Command" Setting**  
   - Find the **"Run Command"** setting and update its value.  
   - By default, the value is set to `xppaut`. You can change it to:
     - A full path to the `xppaut` executable (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/xppaut`).
     - A completely different command if needed.

4. **Save Your Changes**  
   - Once youâ€™ve updated the setting, the extension will use your custom command whenever you click the "Run ODE File" button.

## Version 0.2.0 Release Notes

Weâ€™re excited to introduce new features and improvements in version 0.2.0 of our VS Code extension! A special thanks to **Nianqi Deng** for suggesting the "Run Button" featureâ€”your feedback is invaluable!

### New Features

#### 1. Added "Run ODE File" Button  

- A new button has been added to run `xppaut <current ode file>` directly from the editor.  
- The button features a play icon using VS Code's built-in Codicons for intuitive usability.  
- A configuration setting has been introduced to allow users to customize the run command.  
- The command execution now uses the configured command, providing flexibility for different workflows.

#### 2. Implemented "Extract Variable" Feature  

- This feature simplifies code refactoring by allowing users to extract variables from their code with ease.

#### 3. Bug Fixes  

- Removed `e` from the constant and reserved word list.
